            "UCrJdCKIddUxHExmbMN6gZ9A,lKbiTDXwpY0,\"I don’t know if it was Bigfoot or not, but I have also encountered some strange things in the woods next to my grandparents house. You see, ever since I was small I have had this connection to the supernatural world in the sense that I can sense when they are near me. For background, my grandpa would throw in his cows and goats into the woods for the day and at sundown he would bring them back into the corrals. I would also walk in those woods by myself and just take a stick in case a snake passed by me. They were safe woods. This one time though, I arrived to my grandparents house and I could feel something within my soul screaming to stay away from the woods. I didn’t plan to tell anyone about it until my cousin urged me to take a walk through the woods with her. I told her that there was something in there more powerful than us and that I wouldn’t go. She told me if I didn’t go with her she would go by herself. Now obviously I wasn’t about to let her go by herself when I knew the consequences of doing that so in the end I told her to listen to everything I tell her and if for any reason I tell her to run, she should do it immediately, no questions asked and that I would leave her behind if she stayed behind. Now the spot where I felt they were in wasn’t that far, probably about 250 yards from the entrance of the woods. The thing is there was only one route we could take until we passed a bend and the path divided into three. By the time we got to that division I felt as if I were going to faint, and it was not from walking. The best way to describe how I was feeling is like prey walking into enemy territory and knowing that it was stronger than you. My cousin asked me which one of the three paths the thing was in and I answered her the second one. She gave me a smile and dashed into the second path with me trying to run after her quietly. As I did the feeling of dread continued to rise and then I heard voices. I don’t know how to explain the voices but they were not fully human. The language they are speaking was ancient and by that I mean it wasn’t any language used today that I have heard people talk. I grabbed my cousin and forced her to crouch behind some cacti while I tried to make sense of what they were saying. Me being me, I grabbed my phone and tried to record the conversation however I didn’t have my phone on silent so when I clicked record, the little “ding” sounded and the voices turned silent. Without thinking, I pulled my cousins up, yelled run, and ran in front of her. We ran back and she told her mother, my aunt, about it. Eventually everyone knew about it and wanted to go check it out but I knew they wouldn’t find much since they were gone already, my soul was at ease and it was only the adrenaline that stayed behind. True to my beliefs when we got to the spot there were no traces of anything, it was as if they were never there. Let’s just say that my cousin learned to obey me when it came to entering the woods and I learned to make better excuses when wanting to avoid meeting more supernatural beings. I still go to the woods but not entirely alone, I take my dog with me. It makes me feel better knowing I have someone with me who has a better sense of smell than me and better instincts.\",@Lizz737,2024-11-30T15:21:24Z,2024-11-30T15:21:24Z,UCeMofYd3aGxoIWF6IJ160bg,1\n",

I wandered off a lot to explore and get the good ground, i dont get lost easily since i was a boy scout. Sometimes there are sounds or traks that dont quite seem right but the edgy feeling can always be put down as ridiculous or frighty. I would absolutely not be doing that at night though. One day the whole group was spreading lime on a ridge and sone of us spotted a large bear heading towards our vehicles parked at the trail access. The though that it was tryi g to get our lunches was a bit funny, but if it was just me or a small group of us i&#39;d be more worried about getting cut off from the vehicle. At that same place another day i steped on an unstable rock which fliped over revealing a knife sharp edge which would have lacerated my thigh if i had not been wearing jeans, as it was i got badly scrapped amd was sent to the truck with a friend. While there alone together we heard heavy sounds from the bush near by, from the area the bear had been before. After wipping the blood off and dressing my leg we got the hell out of there and back up the ridge, i admit checking over our shoulders every minute😅. The thought of something more intelligent than a bear but of similar size it terrifying, but it just gives us a taste of the lives of our neolithinc ancestors who lived with megafauna predators.\",@gregoryvigneault1824,2024-11-29T02:19:58Z,2024-11-29T02:22:53Z,UCX_BRV2nKZrPl_wJm0P_10g,0\n",

I do have one story that my great grandfather told my dad. He was hunting along the Ocmulgee River in central GA in the 1940s when with his brother. They were down in a branch as they call it hunting squirrels when the sun started going down so he and his brother started to make their way back out to the road so they could go home. They got the feeling that something was following them. Maybe a bobcat or a bear that were common among the area at the time. As they went along the forest the feeling went away until they came to a clearing. There sitting on a stump was a large, hairy creature that “smelled like something dead.” Apparently it had muddy caked hair that was so thick that they couldn’t tell where its eyes were at. It just sat on the stump. He and his brother then told this thing that as long as it sat there and didn’t move. There wouldn’t be any trouble. They cocked their shotguns (with birdshot so what good that would do) and make their way out of the woods back to the dirt road and ran home leaving their squirrels behind. Once again I wasn’t born then just a story my dad said his grandpa told him when they grew up in that part of GA.\",@StashTreasure,2024-11-27T11:50:43Z,2024-11-27T11:50:43Z,UCspruJf7_VA2KruYaAmIFPg,1\n",

He told me he was working in a remote part of our stations area on a midnight shift. He was responding to a sensor activation. It was located behind a gated forested area. The access road to the gate ran at a 45° angle  from the main road. If there was someone usually entering illegally from Canada they would follow the gravel road thru the forest and get picked up on the main road. Agents would usually leave the vehicle by the gate and walk up the gravel road for a few hundred yards and wait to intercept the traffic. When my fellow agent started walking in past the gate, you could still see the main road through the trees, especially on a full moon night.  What he heard and saw in the trees between the gravel road and the main road startled him. There was something large and bipedal standing upright and moving slightly in the trees. At this point, he told me he said screw it and walked back to his patrol vehicle. <br>He contacted radio and called it no violation.\",@jimb.942,2024-11-27T08:33:41Z,2024-11-27T08:33:41Z,UC06mhNesZGQtI2KK0QwGDuQ,4\n",

However,  that was impossible. His men had left hours earlier and the village was completely empty. The fear of the tiger had driven them all away. So who or what was screaming in the woods? He saw the deer in a clearing nearby stop grazing and run away panicked, so Corbett was not imaging things.  He remained in his tree and did not go to investigate.

            "UCrJdCKIddUxHExmbMN6gZ9A,lKbiTDXwpY0,\"I have no problem believing these peoples&#39; accounts, because I&#39;ve heard things whistling in the woods at night too; things that shouldn&#39;t be there.  <br>In a wooded ravine behind my late father&#39;s house, where my sister and brother in law now live, out in rural Oregon, I heard a whistling call that exactly mimicked one I had just made myself when trying to call in a dog who had wandered too close to the woods.  <br>I had been house/dog-sitting with my mom, while my sis and her husband were out of town, and we had let their dogs out to relieve themselves late one night before we&#39;d planned to head to bed.  There was an extremely creepy feeling in the air that night, and my mother and I both felt as though we were being watched.  The forest there is right behind the house, and this one little dog had wandered over to the very edge of it.  My instincts told me to get her away from the woods immediately, and my hair was standing on end as I ran toward her to bring her back toward the house.  I whistled and called to her as I ran, and then picked her up and began to jog back toward the front of the house where my mother was waiting with the other dogs.  Behind me as I began to head back, a clear, loud whistle rang out.  It wasn&#39;t a bird, or any other animal.  It sounded exactly like a human whistling, and was the same couple of notes that I had just whistled to call the dog.  My mother heard it as well, and said &quot;that wasn&#39;t you whistling, was it?&quot;  We both knew immediately that we weren&#39;t alone.  Something was there, watching and listening, and it had just announced its presence.  Either it wanted to call the dog back toward the woods, or it was whistling to frighten us.  I will never know for sure.<br>We both agreed that it probably wasn&#39;t a human, because we were on a stretch of fenced private property in the middle of nowhere.  The nearest neighbors were about a half mile away.  Nobody should have been in the woods that night.  Especially without a light.<br>We immediately ran inside, and I spent the rest of the night keeping watch.  We didn&#39;t see a sasquatch, but we&#39;ve heard all kinds of eerie sounds from those woods over the years: deep male voices muttering in some unintelligible language, loud knocking sounds, and sometimes moans and howls.  Sometimes I&#39;ve heard a voice so deep and booming that it sounds like a massive bass sub-woofer... but remember, there is no road through those woods.  No houses.  No people.<br>I am fairly certain that we heard a sasquatch whistling at us that night, and I hope I never hear such a thing again.  It sounded really close, like 30-50 feet at the furthest.  It felt as though we were in real danger.  No other whistle I&#39;ve ever heard contained such an unbelievable level of menace.  It may not sound scary, but whistles can be terrifying under certain circumstances.  Just thought I&#39;d share our little adventure with whomever reads this.  I know it&#39;s not the most sensational story, but it happened, and I think that, for me at least, it adds credence to what the people depicted in this video were describing.  <br>Stay safe in the woods, everybody.  Best wishes.  --Naomi\",@naomiseraphina9718,2024-11-25T06:47:31Z,2024-11-25T06:47:31Z,UCPBKnufFctc7hkpQOdBc2uw,2\n",

They’ve been observing humans for a VERY long time.  They know our reactions and our limits better than we know ourselves.  And they lure us into the woods!  They lure men with the scream of women in need, they lure women with the crying of babies, and they lure kids with the sounds of kids playing.  And most of those who fall for it are never seen again.  Pure devilry.<br><br>My distant ancestors should have eradicated them the way we did the rest of the megafauna.

The sun was going down and I had decided it was time to come off the mountain as it was getting dark, I was paying closer attention to my surroundings because I had no luck so I was hoping to pick off something on the way home, I had stopped all at once to tie my shoe and my heart sank when I heard a snow muffled step behind me, I had been hunting long enough to know I was being tracked and whoever or whatever that was trailing me knew to step in time with me to keep noise low, without turning around I pulled a granola bar to eat, I wasn&#39;t hungry but I knew if it was an animal behind me it would sense my panic and strike so I tried my best to keep calm but it didn&#39;t help. I started running all at once, I was too afraid to turn around so I just ran facing ahead, twigs snapped and the snow crunched but I didn&#39;t turn around, I slipped and rolled down a hill to a paved side road and thankfully whatever that was chasing me stopped at the tree line, I never went hunting after that and I live on the inner side of WV now, far from any wooded area.

It sorta sniffs into the air like a dog picking up a scent and it looks straight in my direction but mind you its pitch-black and i can only see this thing because of my night time optical, well this animal thing cranes its face upward kinda like its gonna howl like a wolf at the moon maybe, but it screams &quot;HELP! HELP MEEE!!&quot; and its a woman&#39;s voice, but this thing is no woman, it&#39;s not even human.

My dad cousins and uncles would all go out to my dads uncles cabin for archery hunting/ a week of beer drinking and bullshitting.

And it was right up until it wasnt.<br>Id shot a decent buck on the 3rd day in the late morning. I knew it wasnt the greatest of shots but definitely lethal. This part of ohio is all steep hilly woods and the deer had gone uphill so i figured the animal would go down quicker from blood loss. So i get out of my tree and im gathering my gear when i hear crashing noises, i thought this was the deer going down and then i heard a combo yell hoot roar type sound and as i was contemplating what exactly might make that noise when i heard more crashing and then KASPLOOSH. The small pond or giant puddle to my immediate right just had a boulder land in it. The water was only about a foot deep and the rock sticking up out of the middle with water still rippling away from it was big, in fact in a fire fight it would have qualified as cover. And as the lizard portion of my brain is mashing the red alert button i hear that sound again and i could see where whstever it was, was moving at the top of the hill. Now i love archery its the only kind of hunting ill do, but im also not an idiot because going into the woods is a voluntary way of a human reentering the food chain so i had a pistol just a 9mm but.

It&#39;s not military related or to do with this video but I&#39;ve always wanted to bring it up.<br><br>This was around when I was 7 or 8 in the mid 90s. South Wales, United Kingdom. My family lived in a small semi-detached house in a closed off street. The house itself was modern and recently built at the time.<br><br>I shared a bedroom upstairs with my younger brother. We had a bunk bed. He slept below and I was up top. There was a small access panel slightly to the right of our bunk bed on the ceiling that would get you into the attic.<br><br>I&#39;ve always had problems sleeping at night, even as a child. So I often would lay in bed waiting to nod off. Almost every night, sometime around midnight, when everyone else was sleeping, I would get visits.<br><br>At the bottom of my bed I would see a rope fall down from the ceiling and then these creatures would glide down. Couldn&#39;t see them very well as it was very dark, but a little bit of light would come through the curtains. They looked somewhat like trolls or goblins, about the size of a newborn baby. Hard to really say as they were like shadows. They were very quiet and sometimes I would hear them whisper to each other.<br><br>When they would appear I would squeeze my eyes closed and often would fall asleep pretty quickly. I wanted nothing to do with them. I was very cowardly as a child.<br><br>I told my parents and of course they didn&#39;t believe me. I was never an imaginative child but I was still a child. So I wanted to get them proof.<br><br>I snuck a cheap, yellow coloured, point and shoot camera under my pillow that night. And sure enough that night they came again. But this time things were a little different.<br><br>I was laying on my right side, facing the wardrobe on the other wall, trying to go to sleep. Suddenly I heard voices coming from the top of the wardrobe. I couldn&#39;t see anything but I knew they were there. I wish I could remember what was said but I was very scared. I knew my camera was under my pillow, but it hadn&#39;t been properly prepared. It also occurred to me that I could be in danger if they got alerted to what I was hoping to do. Getting off the bunk was not a quick thing to do. At this point I was wide eyed, very awake and not sleepy. So... I turned over in bed to face the other way, again I didn&#39;t want anything to do with the situation.<br><br>Immediately as I turned I heard one of them, with a shocked gasp, say &quot;He&#39;s awake! Quick!&quot;. Or something to that effect (again, I was a child in panic and can&#39;t remember the exact words spoken).<br><br>I then felt a very warm sensation in the middle of my back. 2 seconds later... Poof! I was gone. Sleep. I remember vividly the moment I was knocked out.<br><br>After that night I didn&#39;t see or hear them again. Not long after we moved home.<br><br>I&#39;ll never forget that house. And it wasn&#39;t just those nightly visits either. I remember seeing white orbs floating in my parents bedroom on a couple occasions. They were almost fairy-like in appearance.<br><br>But this is not the end of the story. <br><br>About a year and half ago my parents and I were watching a paranormal TV show and we had a conversation about such things. I thought it would be a good time to bring up my experiences. Neither of them remembered my visitations but my father seemed very interested. He turned to me and said, &quot;You know, we did have a water poltergeist in that house.&quot; My mother said she remembered that too.<br><br>He said the ceiling of the kitchen always had a water leak.

Had trails all throughout.  After spending time in the woods and the glacier that sat in those woods deeper in, I would walk back to the house which was about a football field away from the beginning of the trails to the woods and coming out, had a grass covered path in front of me, and a hill to my left.  And everytime I got to the edge of the woods, I would look back behind me, getting the feeling that something was watching me, and I would always sprint to the house.  Bolting.

It&#39;s a modern invention loosely adapted from a myth in my mind, what&#39;s interesting to me is the real &quot;wild men&quot; legends. Perhaps the natives before the beginning of their civilization, farming and relative overpopulation (so like 10,000 years ago, giving them like five thousand years to evolve) were very large and these tales are of the left-overs. I imagine the people who drove the megafaunal extinction got pretty big (not two digit ft you absolute lunatics) considering the abundance of meat and food in general, they hit the jackpot but in human fashion, spent it too fast and bred like rabbits thinking it would never end. What people can&#39;t understand for some reason is that we just showed up here one day, it was entirely homo-naive but I assume the gravity of that can&#39;t really sink in without a rather decent understanding of ecology. You ever wonder why Africa still has its megafauna? We evolved alongside that environment (and partly Asia) for literally millions of years, it&#39;s incredibly complex but it might be easier if you think of The Americas as an island.. you can&#39;t just introduce rats without a extinction event taking place and that&#39;s just rats. Not goddamn homosapiens with weapons and horrifyingly effective tribal structure, the Younger-dryas was tough but I&#39;m willing to bet all my life for money that it was mainly us. The evidence seems pretty concrete that this double whammy was responsible, animals are too tough and resilient for it to have been mainly the return to ice age conditions. We actually began farming out of necessity during this time so people came together quickly and the world was revolutionized, whether early coastal cities were wiped out at the start of this is neither here nor there. It&#39;s funny, people openly admit that we were responsible for this happening in Australia because it happened way earlier than the rest of the world and again.. it&#39;s islandish but it also didn&#39;t happen to coincide with any climatic inconvenience.

I rode, hunted, camped and went in caves in that exact area continually from 1974 to about 1981 (moved away), and unfortunately I never saw or heard anything of the sort he wrote about. I did, on the other hand, routinely run across old stills and current (at that time) pot patches. A person had to be careful about getting too close to those patches. I had guns stuck in my face more than once, and if you look through old episodes of &quot;unsolved mysteries&quot; you will find that people in that area did sometimes disappear, most likely because they showed up when criminals were up to no good. A guy I currently work with has a cabin on the cliffs overlooking the sequatchie valley there, and while there have been some bad people who have stolen stuff from his place, there has never been anything like a sasquatch in that area.

            "UCrJdCKIddUxHExmbMN6gZ9A,lKbiTDXwpY0,\"I don&#39;t 100% believe in a Bigfoot but I do believe there is something that these people are seeing and running into out in the woods.  One of the most compelling stories I&#39;ve read and then heard was about this former FBI agent who went on to be a small town sheriff up in Oregon from the late 70s until the early 90s.  He was former military as well I just don&#39;t remember if he served in the Army or Marines, anyways his childhood friend became mayor and found out he retired from the FBI then offered him the job of being the town Sheriff well one day after he got off work he went to pay his respects to another feie d who had died and the family buried him out in the woods a mile or two from this town so the now Sheriff goes out there to talk to his friend and as he&#39;s coming back he sees a big hairy person thing out in the middle of these woods, we are talking 1980s no GPS, had to use a map to get other era so it&#39;s not like someone is going to  find him out there.  We&#39;ll the hairy manimal starts screaming and yelling but nit like a human like something he&#39;s never heard because it fills up the woods and sounds like it it&#39;s coming from all over, he starts running back to his truck which is a few miles away.  After about a mile he slows down to listen and he hears what sounds like trees falling, not being chopped but being broken and then falling down, he turns around and feels that feeling when you know you&#39;re being watched and the screaming or yelling starts again but this time is louder or closer again it&#39;s filling up the forest and sounds like it&#39;s coming from all directions, he starts running again and again he hears trees being broken and falling down but this time it&#39;s one both sides behind him and he doesn&#39;t stop running this time.  He said he didn&#39;t feel like it was trying to catch him or harm him just it was herding him back to his truck because he just ran away from the sounds and it lead him right back to his truck.  He never looked at his map to get back so this thing forced him back to his truck and heading him.  Mr. Ballen has a video about this story and I was able to find a written recounting of it.  Why it&#39;s compelling to me is the person involved isn&#39;t someone who you&#39;d normally hear a story like this from.  He wasn&#39;t trying to get famous, or make money off his story or to write a book.  He was former military, retired FBI, and the current sheriff who went to pay respects to his friend.  Someone who had that much discipline, training, and years of real service to his country are not the types to make this stuff up because it would ruin their reputation as a Sheriff and as an honest hard working man.  In the 80s in a small town your reputation was everything, it&#39;s not like today when people will sell their soul for internet fame and have no shame.  I believe something chased/ was herding him to his truck to force him out of this forested area, was it a Bigfoot? Or maybe another cryptid? I have no idea but something was out there.\",@CL053DC45K37,2024-11-23T01:44:04Z,2024-11-23T01:45:17Z,UCWDCqL08cqnfUBS3eyv7BMg,1\n",

I don&#39;t know ANY predatorial animal that does that.  Coyotes certainly don&#39;t.  I use these calls to call in coyotes to kill them.  But, the worst thing a coyote could do would pretend to be injured or weak in ANY way.  It would most certainly get them killed by man, or beast.  No sir. that&#39;s not a thing.  Also, animals don&#39;t think like humans.  We have a soul.  We have free choice.  They only run on instinct.  For instince.  WE as people can make a choice to do something we don&#39;t want to do at all, but because it&#39;s the right thing, we will do it.  Coyotes don&#39;t do that.  They are predictable because they thrive on instinct alone.  Like ALL animals..Even everybodies best friend the domesticated dog.

            "UCrJdCKIddUxHExmbMN6gZ9A,lKbiTDXwpY0,\"Awesome content as usual. First I believe in bigfoot and it has always been said that bigfoot can mimic any species, so I have no doubt if they wanted to they could sound similar to a coyote.  Now that being said, the 1st story is almost certainly made up. I say this not through the knowledge of bigfoot, but through the knowledge of coyotes and predator hunting. Coyotes do not act injured if you find their den or for that matter their pups. If you are lucky enough to find a den, if coyotes were around they might circle you staying within cover while they watch you. Or if their were pups in the den and you went after them the adults may even charge, but they most certainly don&#39;t play dead or act injured. They aren&#39;t killdeer and when found they run for the hills 9/10 times. Coyotes also don&#39;t yip as they just stroll through the night or day. They are very social and vocal but they typically only yip or vocalize when other animals are doing it, or when trying to locate other members. They don&#39;t just vocalize as they stroll through the night. They will call and then they shut up and go on their way. Remember he says that this is the coyote behavior he normally sees and thats how him and his friend hunt them which is simply not how coyotes act, ever. This is why i can say confidently that this guy doesn&#39;t know anything about coyote behavior. Also in all my years of predator hunting I have never heard someone choose a 30-06 to hunt varmints with. Its not a caliber suited to that mission. A 308 is also a choice I don&#39;t know that anyone would make. Its extremely overkill and meant for large game. Both are 30 caliber platforms and those bullets travel slow. For varmints you want fast. The overall way he tells the story and the information he gives is almost a guarantee someone made that story up. Bigfoot do exist though and they do mimic animals. But if you think a bigfoot is carrying around a bottle of coyote urine and a handful of poo to try and lure you in, then you aren&#39;t the outdoorsman you claim.\",@carl8229,2024-11-22T18:07:03Z,2024-11-22T18:10:26Z,UCXIEs099Pcp-XvrOsEYCOrQ,2\n",
