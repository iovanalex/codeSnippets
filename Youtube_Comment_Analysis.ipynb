Sabaton</b><br><br><br><b>A1.</b> I asked myself that question because it wasn&#39;t obvious from his email why they didn&#39;t and I neglected to ask about it in my follow-up email. I suppose he might have expected my own military knowledge would fill in the blanks. The only thing he did say is that they didn&#39;t fire on the medevac vehicle, which is likely the reason it was the only vehicle able to drive away. But after considering it, unless their SOPs for that situation were in fact to engage with the enemy (which seems unlikely during a medevac), the possible reason is that rubber tires don&#39;t hold up well against 12.7mm machine gunfire. Until I can get clarification back from Cap, I can only assume the first vehicle was crippled and unable to continue driving. I didn&#39;t want to animate that as an obvious fact in case it wasn&#39;t true. Once the first vehicle was down, whether the rear vehicle was also crippled or not, I doubt it was the standard operating procedure at that point to abandon half his platoon to die, so they stayed on to protect them and engage with the enemy. And also, as much as these stories drag out for minutes in the retelling, it&#39;s likely all of this happened in a matter of seconds, with the rockets completely disabling the vehicles.<br><br><b>A2.</b> The American flags seen on various Ukrainian soldiers&#39; helmets in this video are simply IR (infrared reflective) patches, used for nighttime identification with NVGs.

It is your only chance at survival because if you get pinned down within grenade range, you’re as good as dead. <br>Reacting to an ambush while mounted, as in this scenario, you try to achieve fire superiority with your own weapons while just trying to disengage from the enemy at all costs. Again, stopping or getting pinned down is basically a death sentence because if they’re engaging an armored column, they’re equipped to deal with said armored column. If your vics get taken down, it is indeed a no man gets left behind scenario, but ideally, that’s avoided by your disengagement.<br><br>Planning and executing an ambush is initiated by what we call “the mad minute,” where all friendly forces let loose everything we’ve got for that full minute. Theoretically, everything will be destroyed by the end. Once the enemy has been neutralized, we assault through and quickly search all enemies for intel.

Ukraine, under American and British influence, brought this war upon themselves.

This war, and the bloodshed that resulted lays at the feet of primarily Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Joe Biden.

The Russians who were killed could’ve maneuvered to a more advantageous spot and their reserve could’ve mistaken them for Ukrainians counterattacking (the best defense to a close range ambush is to charge directly at the enemy) so they opened fire. Stuff like this is common in high stress situations even among well trained soldiers, the US special forces frequently got into friendly fire incidents in the Middle East. The scream could be them trying to communicate that they were friendly but it could’ve been to late by then. After realizing their mistake the rearguard would realize that they don’t have enough men to fight off a counterattack by impending reinforcements and decided to retreat to their predetermined locations.

The then President, understanding the economic impact to his country if he signed on to join the EU, pulled back and accepted the Russian offer instead. This triggered the EU and NATO as they wanted Ukraine. The Donbass region and Crimea are Russian speaking Ukrainians, and the Azovs who took over after the coup along with the Nazi&#39;s not only demanded the people of the Donbass region and Crimea stop speaking Russian, but they made it law that outlawed Russian and they would be required to go to re-education camps. Naturally they refused and turned to Russia for help. In the ensuing years, Ukraine military regularly shelled and bombed Donbass cities, maiming and killing over 14,000 citizens. You should now recall that the Minsk Agreement that was signed and designed to bring peace was never implement, despite pleas from Russia and the people of the Region. In point of fact, German head minister Merkel and former French President Hollande admitted that the Minsk Agreement was a sham designed to give Ukraine time to train its military, build defenses, and organize plans for it to go on the offensive to take back Crimea and the Donbass regions. All they had to do was implement the Minsk agreement and this wouldn&#39;t even be a story to be told. Thus far Russia has exercised restraint, and was hoping cooler heads would prevail, but all of that is out the window now. As for Russia...well, you will have to refer back to the Visions of Our Lady of Fatima given in 1917, Portugal and witnessed by over 40,000 people. Instructions were left for the Church to consecrate Russia unto the Immaculate Heart of Our Lady,, otherwise God, in the final days will use Russia against the wayward nations (Perverse, perversions, reference to Sodom and Gomorrah, pedophilia, corruption of children. the innocent) The Church did not heed that warning and instead, by their actions said, Who is Mary? We don&#39;t worship Mary, and we don&#39;t take orders from Mary. Then there was the question concerning the little girl called Fatima, whom the Church encouraged her to join the Sisterhood because she knew the final vision but was not yet given permission from Our Lady to reveal it and when the heads of the Church persisted, Fatima got permission from Mary, and revealed it, then according to researchers, they killed Fatima and replaced her with an imposter. Fatima&#39;s family knew she was an imposter because her ears were not Fatima&#39;s ears. Today, the Church in a panic scrambled to consecrate Russia. They are panicking now because of the seriousness of the final vision that they never revealed and never heeded. It&#39;s too late. Then the visions of Baba Vanga concerning Russia...

Now, this was a time where the insurrection was first developing and Ukraine was beginning to fight the rebels and, from what we know, maybe Putin and the Siloviki didn’t expect the Ukrainians to react at all (think, perhaps, to repeat the success of the revolutions in the Middle East or his recent takeover of Crimea), and by this point clear Russian assets were in risk (take for instance FSB agent Igor Girkin which would become supreme commander of the DNR’s armies) and it clearly seemed that Moscow was eager to take over southern Ukraine (Novorossiya), so a lot of thinks happened at once.<br>First, suddenly over 40,000 Russian soldiers appeared at the border with Ukraine and Putin began to press for negotiations between Kiev and the “rebels”; and secondly, Russian forces in and around Rostov-on-Don began to join the war against Ukraine (although unofficially) and this is where the story develops.<br>The force to which our “Cap” belongs soon found isolated and surrounded, on one side he had the brunt of the DNR’s battalions (Sparta, Somalia, Oplot and Vostok) and on the other 5 VDV regiments (31st, 137th, 247th, 331st and 1065th) sprung into sudden action, all of this against (at most) 1,400 Ukrainians from different units. The Ukrainians became encircled and besieged by the Russians and their commander stroke an agreement for the Ukrainian force to leave the city, however, the Russians disregarded the treaty and mercilessly slaughtered the entire force as the Ukrainians tried to evacuate most of their units, making their story outstanding for being the survivors of nothing short of a military catastrophe (his unit is indeed credited as having been in combat at Ilovaisk).<br>It was disclosed by a high official of the Ukrainian military in 2016, that Ilovaisk was the main reason for Kiev’s decision to accept a ceasefire and the Minsk agreements. <br>And if you are interested, “Cap”’s unit was transferred to Mykolaiv and has been fighting there since the war began, and they have been fairly successful the fight (though the unit suffered from a missile strike in March 18th), but given that the Ukrainians are even, reportedly, conducting an offensive, we might asume he is safe and sound.<br>The only thing it doesn’t fit is the date, from the winter of 2014-2015 onwards, Ukraine didn’t held nothing east of Donetsk and Ilovaisk is near the border with Russia, the battle I’m talking about happened throughout August and September of 2014, and the Ukrainians didn’t return to the surrounding area thereafter.;Comment=@saulruiz5811', 'User=I like to think that the half of Cap&#39;s platoon that died in their BTR-80 came back from the dead to save their comrades;Comment=@Sierra-208', 'User=They were attacked by something.

I have a theory based on what we know about Russia&#39;s deployment of especially cruel, illegal weapons like the Bumblebee &amp; vacuum rockets (designed to suck all the oxygen from lungs of anyone in its trajectory which will, literally, in every case include civilians regardless)- HORRIBLE. Obviously in the last week or so we&#39;re seeing the most egregious criminal Russian aggression, and also hearing bits of their soldiers&#39; confusion at attacking a country they were fooled into thinking was going to welcome them as &quot;liberators&quot; from an oppressive regime. (a testament to widespread Russian naivete &amp; willingness to believe state media) The resulting low morale is a natural response to encountering a populace that is united to stand up and fight. So, back to my theory as to what happened in this bizarre encounter in 2015. This ambush involved the use of the Bumblebee, which is a horrific way to kill an opponent. The 1st shot would&#39;ve resulted in several minutes of agonized screams, people burning alive running away in futility, basically a scene of abject total horror. I theorize that one or two of these young men were so disturbed by the 1st shot, then objected to the second, and when a third was being prepared to fire a legitimate opposition broke out between a few of them &amp; their squad. Shouting turned to fighting, and escalated to &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; hence the internal gunfight which very fortunately eliminated all of them- ensuring 8 less Russian invaders would be in service right now.;Comment=@AndyBonesSynthPro', 'User=US flags on Ukrainian helmets?;Comment=@jez6208', 'User=Good choice of song btw.

Early the next morning, when the army of Israel arose, all 185,000 soldiers were dead. 36 As a result, King Sennacherib of Assyria left and returned to Nineveh where he lived. Later on, as he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with a sword and fled into the territory of Ararat. Then Sennacherib’s son Esarhaddon became king in his place.;Comment=@danksauron3172', 'User=Man ,  those Russians can’t get along with anyone;Comment=@daveatkins3568', 'User=The BBC called the bumble bee bomb a vacuum bomb because it also creates a vacuum that sucks out all the breathable air around it.

Everyone is jumping on the bandwagon without understanding the first thing about this conflict. Essentially, Ukraine has been in a civil war since 2014 or so. One side is ethnically Russian and has essentially seceded from the rest of Ukraine. Russia got involved in response to the EU and NATO&#39;s own involvement. They shouldn&#39;t be bringing weapons into Ukraine - it violates a number of treaties and agreements. Not to mention all of the money that is involved with gas pipeline (think Hunter Biden/Burisma). <br> The media has been putting out lie after lie to create sympathy for Ukraine. Stop and think for a minute. Is the news on this conflict like coverage of any other war you&#39;ve seen? It&#39;s all designed to elicit an emotional response, motto bring you factual information. Ghost of Kiev, Snake Island, all of this BS has been debunked already. The pictures of Zelensky in military fatigues are old photos, he&#39;s not fighting on the front lines. The pictures of Miss Ukraine are from her Instagram page - she plays airsoft. All of the attacks have been precision strikes on military targets. If you&#39;re invading somewhere, the first thing you go after is infrastructure - communication, power, etc. All of Ukraine&#39;s utilities are still intact. Putin isn&#39;t going around slaughtering civilians. They&#39;re making him out to be worse than Hitler, but he&#39;s already tried to have peace talks. The other countries that are trying to get involved are only fanning the flames. Don&#39;t just take my word for it, if you do some research, you can confirm what I&#39;m saying without much difficulty.<br> You all should know better than to trust the media by now. What happened to COVID? Narrative falling apart? Midterm polling not doing so good? Time to move on to the next fabricated crises. Why do you all feel the need to take sides on this?

Why didn&#39;t they just drive through the ambush?</b><br><b>2. Why are Ukrainian soldiers wearing American patches?</b><br><b>3. Sabaton</b><br><br><br><b>A1.</b> I asked myself that question because it wasn&#39;t obvious from his email why they didn&#39;t and I neglected to ask about it in my follow-up email. I suppose he might have expected my own military knowledge would fill in the blanks. The only thing he did say is that they didn&#39;t fire on the medevac vehicle, which is likely the reason it was the only vehicle able to drive away. But after considering it, unless their SOPs for that situation were in fact to engage with the enemy (which seems unlikely during a medevac), the possible reason is that rubber tires don&#39;t hold up well against 12.7mm machine gunfire. Until I can get clarification back from Cap, I can only assume the first vehicle was crippled and unable to continue driving. I didn&#39;t want to animate that as an obvious fact in case it wasn&#39;t true. Once the first vehicle was down, whether the rear vehicle was also crippled or not, I doubt it was the standard operating procedure at that point to abandon half his platoon to die, so they stayed on to protect them and engage with the enemy. And also, as much as these stories drag out for minutes in the retelling, it&#39;s likely all of this happened in a matter of seconds, with the rockets completely disabling the vehicles.<br><br><b>A2.</b> The American flags seen on various Ukrainian soldiers&#39; helmets in this video are simply IR (infrared reflective) patches, used for nighttime identification with NVGs. They were possibly purchased from or supplied to the Ukrainian Army from the US, hence the American flag. They are very common patches among US forces and are available for purchase online to anyone.<br>Link to a reference photo: <a href=\"https://cdn2.picryl.com/photo/2017/08/21/a-ukrainian-observer-coach-trainer-looks-on-as-soldiers-cce0f0-1600.jpg\">https://cdn2.picryl.com/photo/2017/08/21/a-ukrainian-observer-coach-trainer-looks-on-as-soldiers-cce0f0-1600.jpg</a><br><br><b>A3.</b> <a href=\"UCrJdCKIddUxHExmbMN6gZ9A/W-xNYNbHFIrv8gSn9paABQ\"></a>For my fellow Sabaton fans, I wish I could claim I came up with that little tribute, but it was inspired by this, which is still awesome: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKtG9fkdmSw\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKtG9fkdmSw</a>;Comment=@WartimeStories', 'User=Dude, I think this is fake.
